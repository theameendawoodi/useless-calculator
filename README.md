# 🤖✨ Useless AI-Powered Calculator™  
*A groundbreaking, totally revolutionary, completely pointless regression-based calculator... powered by ✨artificial intelligence✨, bad decisions, and the raw power of unchecked ambition.*

## 🚀 Welcome to the Dumbest Smart Calculator Ever Built

Introducing the **Useless AI-Powered Calculator™** – a neural network regression model that tries (and fails) to do basic arithmetic. It's over-complicated, underperforming, and absolutely dripping in artificial intelligence buzzwords.

> Built with zero planning. Zero purpose. 100% **vibes**.

## 💡 What Is This?

This project is:

- ❌ Not a calculator
- ❌ Not a useful tool
- ✅ A **vibe-coded monument** to the AI hype cycle
- ✅ A sarcastic middle finger to overengineering
- ✅ A neural network that **feels** the answer more than it computes it

It guesses numbers using a regression ANN. And when it gets close? That’s a win for **hope-based computing**.

## 🧠 How Does It "Work"?

This beauty is powered by:

- 🤖 An artificial neural network (because why use logic?)
- 🔢 Regression models trained on basic arithmetic (badly)
- 🧘 A total lack of performance optimization
- 🧼 Absolutely zero error handling
- 🧪 A single Python file that does everything, poorly

It does not run on logic. It runs on:

- ✨ Hope  
- 🎲 Random weight initializations  
- 🌀 A reckless disregard for correctness  
- 🧃 Pure, unfiltered vibes

## 📦 Installation

Oh, so you actually want to run this?

Wow. Okay.

Here’s how to do it — but maybe ask yourself *why*, first.
